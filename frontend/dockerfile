# Step 1: Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the package.json and package-lock.json (if available)
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Use a lightweight web server to serve the static files
FROM nginx:alpine AS production

# Step 8: Copy the build output from the previous step
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 9: Expose the port on which Nginx will serve the app
EXPOSE 80

# Step 10: Start the Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
